We simulate a toll plaze with 8 tollbooths and 3 lanes of travel.

Common vehicles are usually $4-4.5m$ long and $1.65-1.85m$ wide,
so a vehicle will take up 2 cells.
According to the \emph{Green Book, 1994}, an appropriate design of
a toll plaze would be a trapezoid with a
168-meter-long recovery zone and a 612-meter-long departure zone.
The width of a tollbooth along with a toll island
is usually $5.5m$, while that of each lane is $3.5-4m$.
We set the length of each cell equal to $2m$: $l_{car}=4m$.
So the parameters are as follows:
\[
{l}_{veh}=2\\
{w}_{veh}=1\\
WB={W}_{b}B=3\times8=24\\
WL={W}_{l}L=2\times3=6\\
{L}_{r}=84\\
{L}_{d}=306\\
\]

Figure~\ref{fig:q-p} shows the relationship between current throughput and
traffic flow density with different ${p}_{v}$.

%｛翻译｝当流量取得最大值q_max时对应的临界密度{d}_{c}，zhegetu
%被临界midu划分为两部分，当流量小于临界密度dc时，车流为自由流.
%pv是随机减速概率，it varies between different drivers.figure shows that pv越小，对应的
%capacity 越大，dc也越大。在下面的章节里，我们主要采用了Pv=0.5来讨论，因为这时capacity约为700
%veh/h/lane，与实际情况个较为吻合

\label{fig:q-p}

\end{figure}

The density in the correspondence with the maximal throughput $q_{max}$ is
defined as critical density $d_{c}$. We can distinguish that the curves in
Figure~\ref{fig:q-p} are divided into two sections by that critical density.
If the flow density is lower than $d_{c}$, it will be a free flow; otherwise,
a crowded flow.

As mentioned above, ${p}_{v}$ is the probability of random deceleration.
It varies among different drivers. It is not difficult to conclude
that the smaller the value is, the larger $q_{max}$ is accessible. At the same
time, $d_{c}$ will increase correspondingly. In the following chapters, we
choose to adopt ${p}_{v}=0.5$ as our basis, because the $q_{max}$ at this time is
consistent with the actual value, approximately $700veh/h/lane$.
